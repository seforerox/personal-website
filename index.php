            <p>My name is Santiago Esteban Forero Su√°rez, I am from Colombia, since I was 10 years old, my passion has always been technology and languages.</p>
            <p>Since I was 7 years old I joined a 7 year-long english course, after a lot of effort it worked!, in 2019 I graduated from it, thanks to that now I consider myself bilingual (I speak english and spanish), however it wasn't enough for me, so I decided to start learning German.</p>
            <p>When I was 11 years old, I started exploring the world of technology, firstly I learned the basic tags of html, I noticed it wasn't enough for making something cool, so I learned CSS and Javascript, then I started learning Python and C++, in consecuence I started developing web servers and found Linux, I changed my computer's operative system because it was better for me. After that I discovered data sciene and artificial intelligence, something that is really interesting and useful.</p>
